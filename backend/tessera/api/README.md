# Run API (PLT-06)

`create_app(engine=..., registry=..., settings=...)` supports isolated tests and
service configuration; the default application opens its database lazily.
`/docs` describes the HTTP contracts, also exported by `make types`.

POST `/api/runs` accepts the frozen RunSpec fields except `run_id` (server UUID),
validates installed module declarations and schedules the actual orchestrator.
GET `/api/runs` and `/api/runs/{run_id}` expose snapshots and module status.
Documents and cases are readable only after successful/degraded publication.
Document detail includes matching canonical segments, observations and entity
links. Store filters cannot widen the run's declared scope; IDs never become
filesystem paths.

Run lookup, publication status and artifact reads share one database transaction.
A concurrent reset cannot recreate a deleted run or mix its old configuration
with new results. The run list skips entries deleted after enumeration. Pending,
running, blocked and failed runs keep their metadata visible, but all document
and case endpoints return 409 until publication. Successful and degraded runs
are readable; starting a new run or demo scenario leaves older complete runs
available with their original snapshot and timestamp.

Fixture access requires both `FIXTURE_MODE=1` and `?fixture=true`. Product requests
cannot authorize fixtures, and neither submission path automatically loads them.
Production module tasks still need to provide MANIFEST/run entry points: an empty
or uninstalled graph is rejected instead of being presented as a successful run.

The MVP worker runs in process with one orchestrator lock. Queued work does not
survive a server restart; start a fresh run after an interrupted job. Published
artifacts and run metadata are durable in SQLite. Durable job recovery is outside
PLT-06. Use a single API worker process, as specified by the prototype architecture.
